# Python Environment

A structured Python workspace for all things Python:  
- Data engineering  
- Machine learning projects  
- Algorithm and problem-solving practice  

**Goal:** To provide a single environment for developing Python skills in a professional, organized way, with reusable modules, notebooks, and practice challenges.

## Project Structure

- `src/` — Reusable Python modules and packages
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration and learning
- `tests/` — Test cases for validating modules
- `ML_Environment/` — Machine learning projects reproducing examples from the book by Brian and Lisa
- `Leetcode_Challenges/` — Medium to hard algorithm challenges for skill building
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `.gitignore` — Files and folders excluded from version control

## Tech Stack

Currently using:

- Python 3.11+  
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation  
- SQLAlchemy & psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL integration  
- Jupyter for notebooks  
- pytest for testing 
- VS Code as my text editor 

*(Additional tools and libraries will be added as the environment expands)*

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thembezakhe/python-environment.git
