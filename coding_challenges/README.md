# Coding Challenges

This directory contains Python solutions to coding challenges from multiple platforms.
The purpose is to practice problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and clean code
under interview-style constraints.

## Structure

- **Leetcode_Challenges/**
  - Medium to hard LeetCode problems
  - Focus on data structures, algorithms, and time/space complexity

- **Coderbyte_Challenges/**
  - Coding challenges completed in assessment-style environments
  - Focus on string manipulation, validation logic, and edge cases

## Guidelines

- Each challenge is implemented in its own Python file
- Filenames reflect the challenge name (and platform where applicable)
- Each solution includes:
  - A brief description of the problem
  - The chosen approach
  - Time and space complexity analysis

This folder is part of the broader Python environment used for continuous
technical interview preparation.
