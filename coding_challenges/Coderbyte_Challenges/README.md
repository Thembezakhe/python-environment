# Coderbyte Challenges

This directory contains Python solutions to coding challenges on Coderbyte.

## Purpose

- Store medium to hard coding challenges  
- Document problem-solving approaches  
- Include time and space complexity for each solution

## Guidelines

- Each challenge should be in its own Python file  
- Filename should reference the problem name (and optionally ID if available)  
- Include a docstring at the top describing the problem, approach, and complexity  
- Add inline comments for readability

## Completed Challenges

- **Codeland Username Validation**
  - Focus: string validation, constraints, edge cases
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
