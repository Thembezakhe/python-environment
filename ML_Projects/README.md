# ML Environment

This directory contains machine learning projects with the aim of reproducing examples from the book by Brian and Lisa.

## Purpose

- Practice building ML models end-to-end  
- Learn best practices in feature engineering, model evaluation, and pipeline creation  
- Keep all code organized in a reproducible and modular format

## Structure

- Each project should have its own subfolder or notebook  
- Use `src/` modules whenever reusable code is needed  
- Document experiments and results clearly in Jupyter notebooks
